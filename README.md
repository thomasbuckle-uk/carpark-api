# Carpark Technical Test

## Context

There is a car park at the Manchester Airport.\
The car park has 10 spaces available so only 10 cars can be parked at the same time. \
Customers should be able to park a car for a given period (i.e., 10 days).

## Your Task

Create a simple API, that allows you to make a booking for given dates, manage capacity
(number of free spaces) and an option to check if there’s a car parking space available.



- Customers should be able to check if there’s an available car parking space for a given
date range.

- Customer should be able to check parking price for the given dates (i.e.,
Weekday/Weekend Pricing, Summer/Winter Pricing)
- Customers should be able to create a booking for given dates (from - to)
- Customers should be able to cancel their booking.
- Customers should be able to amend their booking.

## Things to consider.

- Number of available spaces
- API should show how many spaces for given date is available (per day)
- Parking date From - date when car is being dropped off at the car park.
- Parking date To - date time when car will be picked from the car park.

## Expectations

We are not looking for a fully-fledged solution, this is just an opportunity for you to
demonstrate your skills and preferred methods of tackling a problem. \
Unit tests should be included but do not need to cover all the code.

Please feel free to leave comments to help explain things if you feel it’s necessary.

We do not set a specific time limit on the exercise, please take as much time as you are able to.
